/*
Decreasing Sequence with Difference Decreasing Two integers N and D are passed as input.
The program must print the decreasing sequence from N with common difference D. 
The difference D is decremented by 1 when calculating the values every time.
The sequence is printed until D becomes zero.Boundary Condition(s):2 <= N <= 99999991 <= D <= 9999999 
Input Format:The first line contains N and D separated by space(s).Output Format:The first line contains integers separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1
:Input:20
5Output:15 11 8 6 5

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:12 6
Output:6 1 -3 -6 -8 -9
